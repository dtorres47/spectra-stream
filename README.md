# Spectra Stream

Spectra Stream is an interactive streaming system designed to bring dynamic overlays, quests, sound effects, and TTS into live broadcasts.  

The project is currently implemented in **C#/.NET**, and will later be translated into **Go** to demonstrate cross-language adaptability. Both versions follow a **vertical slice architecture** for clarity, scalability, and maintainability.  

This repository is a **work in progress**, with the C# implementation serving as the baseline while the Go project is scaffolded for future translation.
