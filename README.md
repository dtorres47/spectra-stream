# Spectra Stream

**Interactive streaming overlay system** for live broadcasts—powering real-time quests, donations, TTS, and visual effects.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Build a production-ready overlay system in **C#/.NET** (current)
- Translate to **Go** to demonstrate cross-language architecture skills
- Showcase **vertical slice architecture** for maintainable, scalable design

## ✨ Features (In Progress)
- 🎨 **Retro-styled overlay** with pixel art and animated backgrounds
- 📊 **Real-time quest system** via WebSockets
- 💰 **Donation tracking** with persistent logging
- 🎬 **Dynamic animations** triggered by stream events
- 🎛️ **Streamer control panel** for managing quests and testing events

## 🏗️ Current Status
- ✅ **C# implementation**: Core overlay, quest system, and WebSocket communication functional
- 🚧 **Go translation**: Architecture planning in progress

## 🧠 Architecture
Vertical slice design with:
- Backend: HTTP/WebSocket API for event handling
- Frontend: Standalone web overlay with live updates
- Config-driven: JSON-based quests and branding

---

*The C# version serves as the stable baseline. The Go translation will follow once core features are complete.*
